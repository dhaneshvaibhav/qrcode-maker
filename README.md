QR code maker for smart contacts
This project converts a mobile number and name into a QR code, allowing users to share their contact details easily. When someone scans the QR code, the owner receives a notification requesting permission to allow or deny access. Additionally, the owner can set a time limit for how long the contact details remain accessible.

Example Use Case:
In places like cinema halls or shopping malls, instead of manually sharing a phone number with security guards, users can provide a QR code. Upon scanning, the owner gets a permission request and can define how long the contact details can be saved.
